## Tasks to complete:
Develop a C ++ program that should:
1. Support multiple types of 2D curves - circles and ellipses. Each curve must be able to return the area of ​​the shape it forms.
2. Fill the container (std :: vector or std :: list) with pointers to objects of the types mentioned above in random order with random parameters.
3. Sort the curves in the container in ascending order of area.
4. Calculate the total area of ​​all obtained circles.

Execution expectations:
1. The program must use virtual methods.
2. There should be no memory leaks.
3. Curves must be physically correct (radius - positive).
